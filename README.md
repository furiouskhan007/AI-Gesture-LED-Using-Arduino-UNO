# AI-Gesture-LED-Using-Arduino-UNO

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and gesture recognition can be integrated with an Arduino UNO to control LEDs without physical switches. The system recognizes specific hand gestures and maps them to LED operations such as ON, OFF, brightness control, or color change. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  Tech Stack
| Component      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Arduino UNO** | Microcontroller board to interface with LEDs and receive signals. |
| **Gesture Recognition Module** | Could be based on sensor (e.g., MPU6050, PAJ7620), camera + OpenCV, or Mediapipe. |
| **AI/ML Model** | Detects and classifies hand gestures to trigger LED actions. |
| **Serial Communication** | Exchanges data between gesture-processing logic (e.g., Python code or on-device ML) and Arduino. |
| **LEDs** | Output device; supports operations like ON/OFF, brightness control, color cycling. |
| **Software** | Arduino IDE for firmware + Python/OpenCV/CvZone or another environment for gesture processing. |

##  Features
- **Hands-free LED control**: Trigger lights using gesture commands with no physical contact.  
- **Customizable gestures**: Program gestures for different functions like changing brightness, toggling LEDs, or altering color.  
- **Modular architecture**: Easily swap out gesture recognition vision-based.

##  Hardware Requirements
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board)  
- LEDs (single-color or RGB) and appropriate resistors  
- Gesture detection module:
  - 1: Camera module for OpenCV/Mediapipe (e.g., USB webcam)  
- USB cable for Arduino  
- Breadboard and jumper wires
